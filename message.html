          Turning the pages through the calendar and ticking in the clock here
          it arrives 14<sup>th</sup> February. The most awaited day. The day
          itself is a time for every couples to realize the moment and exchange
          the love for each other but for us the day is even more than just a
          valentine's day. Today we complete one year of being "us" from you and
          me, one year of the exchange of the feelings, one year of the sharing
          of emotions, pain happiness, and one year of trust on each other.If I
          tried to write all the things that I like about you on this card, Iâ€™d
          run out of the room. So here are a few of my favorite things.
        </p>

        <p>
          I still remember how excited I was on this day previous year just to
          share my feelings and accept you as my everything. My happiness knew
          no bound, and there would be no other better day than this to make me
          go back to the time and realize the first day of you and me. The
          charming face of you and your excitement to have me always made me
          felt special, always had me trust on you and imagine you in every nook
          and corner of my life. It was you and only you everything, i don't
          know what special spell have you sprayed on me that I keep on falling
          love with you every single day but whatever it is I am really thankful
          for it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Those messages of you saying I want you forever, every good night
          messages before going for a sleep, your snaps, your beautiful smile
          and everything about you was what made this year a special one and
          full of memories. Thought we were apart from each other for long time
          due to pandemic but yet we were able to sense more love and understand
          the importance of each other in life. We were able to build up trust
          upon each other, we even discovered many ways to express and exchange
          loves.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sharing common interests most of the time, sharing a special
          connection between you and me has always been so special. I agree I
          was insecure most of the times though I trust on you because sometime
          I do really fear what if I happen to lose you, which I never wanted to
          happen. It's you and only you with whom I can lead a decent life, a
          decent family and everything. You are the one with whom I want to
          learn even more about what love is and life is actually because you
          expalin it to me in better way.
        </p>

        <p>
          Trust me dear I love loving you, you are the best thing that has ever
          happened to me and can ever happen. I dont say there are no fights and
          misunderstanding in love, there are but solving them and coming to a
          common agreement is what makes love stronger one. We may fight and
          argue sometimes but we will always try to solve it like we have been
          doing. I will always love to listen you, your problems, your pains and
          I will always try my best to understand you heal you and support you
          in every part of your life no matter what the circumstances are and
          will be. You are mine and I am yours for this life.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the begining of our love, "Someone asked me, Why Padma?" and I
          replied simply the one living in the bank of a pond will never know
          its depth, the one who swims on it will tell you the depth of the
          pond. She may look a simple girl but she is far above than you can
          guess. Really you are special my girl, you are different and I always
          want you to be different, always be who you are changes are common but
          never ever let your good habits be influenced by some bad ones.
        </p>

        <p>
          We may change with time, our face may bear wrinkles we may get weaker
          with time, but we will always make our love stronger, we will never
          let it be weaker or give up on it. We have came through lot more and
          we even have more to come, we have even more memories to be made.
          Let's never give up on this relationship, lets try to make it stronger
          everyday. I am your and you are mine fore this lifetime and let it
          never be changed. Lets keep on falling in love with each other every
          day more and more. I will always keep my words on you and I know you
          will keep it to. Let's keep this padmanish and pama alive forever till
          our last breathe!
        </p>
